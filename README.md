# âœ… List to Checklist

A Chrome extension that converts all list elements into checklist elements, making it easier to keep track of tasks and progress.

Recently, I started #100DaysOfSwift and needed a checklist to keep track of my progress. This extension solves that problem by converting list elements to checklist elements.
